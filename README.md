# Zemoga UI Test

Following the instructions in this [repository](https://github.com/zemoga/ui-test), develop the proposed ui test. The demo can be found at: https://zemoga-ui-test-delta.vercel.app

For personal and work reasons I was only able to carry out the test on days 16, 17 and 18 after 10pm, for which I had a huge time limitation. However, the result was quite successful. Be careful, This is just a little of what it could do.

In the code i leave two ways of handling the data, the first is through getServerSideProps where request to a CMS could go, on the other hand, to be able to persist the votes without having a back or database, I used redux-persist.



# New Features!
If I had had a little more time I would have liked to implement:
- E2E with Cypress.
- Unit Testing with JEST
- 100% of coverage.
- Create an api with data mock to simulate a cms.
- Create generic components such as buttons and fonts to reuse them in the code.

Yes, i can and know do it.

Â¡IMPORTANT!
Due to lack of time, I decided not to carry out the respective unit tests. In a real environment this cannot be missed.
